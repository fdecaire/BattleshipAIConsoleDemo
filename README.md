Demonstration algorithm for finding a PT boat in Battleship board game

Download this console app and explore the algorithm by uncommenting logging and view how the 
computer looks for a PT boat on a 5 by 5 map.  You can change the map size and run other simulations or 
incorporate this algorithm into your own battleship game.

This program was created to accompany my blog post on this algorithm: http://frankdecaire.blogspot.com/2015/01/game-algorithms.html
